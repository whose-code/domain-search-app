# domainsapp

before getting started, run <br />
flutter pub get <br />

## Getting Started

This project invokes REST API endpoints to get realtime domain availability using Flutter application. <br />
API key is necessary to get the info.  <br />
A non-prod API key (for testing) is available within .env directory. Please use it wise.


## Running the App

Enter the domain you wish to search, and hit Search. <br />
At the moment the results are shown within the console. I'm working on pulling them within scaffold ;)
